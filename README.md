# PneuomoVision: A Convolutional Neural Network Software for the Classification of Various Respiratory Illnesses

2023-2024 Research Project.

# Description

Developed two convolutional neural network models with VGG-16 and ResNet to classify fourteen respiratory illnesses through chest X-rays. After determining that ResNet was the more efficient model, a web application titled PneumoVision was developed to provide real-time diagnoses for users on their uploaded chest X-rays.
